## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This **must** be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recUWgp8y9KdGjiaI",

            },
            "createdTime": "2021-03-26T13:10:03.000Z"
        },
        {

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component        | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ---------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Adding prduct Form      |    H     |      3hrs      |        |       |
| Working with API |    H     |      3hrs      |        |       |
| Total            |    H     |      6hrs      |          |        |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
 I can put this together in using react using examples of what we have been doing in the class
### Weaknesses:
 UI/styling and positioning of it tags is still a challenge for me
### Opportunities:
A chance for me to play with uploading images

### Threats:
I don't see any threats here now
